This project is possible future home of SmartCityFarm project. Right now it has:

1. Beitrittsformular

   A 'view only' copy of the farm. Task was to create a form for new members to join the
   association. When Onlyoffice turned to be too unwieldy, I reached for the trusty html+css.
   Printable form can be obtained by pressing =Ctrl+p= (=Cmd+p= on MacOS)
